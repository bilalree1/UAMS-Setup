## 📘 University Admission Management System (UAMS)

A console-based C++ application designed to manage student admission records with features such as adding, updating, deleting, listing, and analyzing student academic data.
This project is ideal for beginners learning arrays, functions, and basic data handling in C++.

## 🚀 Features
## 🔹 User Authentication

 Basic login system (email + password)

## 🔹 Student Management

Add new students

Update existing student records

Delete students using registration number

Search/view a specific student

Display all students

Calculate percentage based on Inter + Matric marks

## 🔹 Core Functionalities

Array-based record storage

Input validation

Clean menu-driven structure

Separate functions for each task

## 🗂️ Program Structure

The project uses fixed-size arrays to store:

names[]

CNICs[]

registrationNos[]

interMarks[]

matricMarks[]

## Each operation is handled using modular functions:

addStudent()

deleteStudent()

updateStudent()

viewSpecificStudent()

viewAllStudents()

viewStudentPercentage()

findStudentIndexByRegNo()

## 📂 File Structure
/UAMS
│
├── main.cpp         # Contains entire program logic
└── README.md        # Project documentation (this file)

## 🛠️ Installation & Compilation
## 🔧 Requirements

C++ compiler (g++, MinGW, Clang, or Visual Studio)

Windows (program uses conio.h → getch())

▶️ Compile & Run

Using g++:

g++ main.cpp -o uams
./uams

## 🧪 How to Use
1️⃣ Login

The program requires the following credentials:

Email:    bilalcs@gmail.com
Password: cs123

2️⃣ Choose an Option from the Menu
1. Add Student
2. Delete Student
3. Update Record
4. View Specific Student
5. View All Students
6. View Student Percentage
7. Exit

3️⃣ Enter Student Information

## The system inputs:

Name

CNIC

Registration Number

Inter Marks (out of 1200)

Matric Marks (out of 1200)

## 📊 Percentage Calculation

The student’s percentage is calculated as:

Total Marks = Inter (1200) + Matric (1200) = 2400

Percentage = (Obtained Marks / 2400) × 100

## 📦 Limitations

Stores up to 100 students (MAX = 100)

No file/database storage (data clears on program exit)

Uses conio.h (Windows-only)

## 🔗 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

Replace arrays with structures & dynamic lists

Add file handling or database storage

Build a GUI version

Add search filters (by name, marks, CNIC)

Improve authentication
